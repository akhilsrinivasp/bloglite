## Features
1. User authentication 
2. Image On Server - File Storage 
3. Independant Server for the Frontend and Backend
4. Blog - Create, Edit and Delete 

## Setup
To get started with the project, you will need to set up both the frontend and backend components. Setting up the frontend is relatively simple, but you should make sure that NPM is installed on your system beforehand. The setup procedures for the frontend and backend are available in the [ReadMe-FRT](https://github.com/akhilsrinivasp/bloglite/blob/main/frontend/README.md) and [ReadMe-BCK](https://github.com/akhilsrinivasp/bloglite/blob/main/backend/README.md) files, respectively.

However, if you prefer a simpler setup process, you can use the script files included in the project. To use the scripts, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run sh setup.sh or ./setup.sh. There are three different scripts included in the project that you can run individually depending on your needs:

```
./setup.sh # Runs the setup process for both the frontend and backend
./run_be.sh # Starts the backend server
./run_fe.sh # Starts the frontend server
```

## API Specification
The backend API of BlogLite is documented in both JSON and YAML format, which can be accessed quickly for testing purposes. You can find the documentation files in the following locations:

* `blite.yaml`: This is the YAML file that contains the backend API documentation. You can use tools like Swagger UI or Postman to view and interact with the API.

* `blite.postman_collection.json`: This is a JSON file that contains the Postman collection for the BlogLite API. You can import this file into Postman to quickly access and test the API endpoints.
